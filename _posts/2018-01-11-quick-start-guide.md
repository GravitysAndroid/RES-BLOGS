JOURNAL #ONE [DAT601]

Learning Summary<br>
<u>WHAT</u>

Class season have involved group work surrounding the development of a Conception Model Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for an online tile game that our group have called 'Game of Tiles'.

In class sessions we have looking at the structure of the ERD specifically the notations and symbols involved in conceptual visualization of a relational database.

<i>Guide to the ERD:</i>

Entity = Rectangle or Square
Attributes = Oval
Relationship = Diamond 

<b>Entity:</b>

An entity is a definable or major element, commonly a noun, that is represented in the database. This could be an object or a person, a concept or event. The entity is the first consideration when looking at database design.

<b>Attribute:</b>

An attribute is something that characterises the entity. For example in the case of 'Game of Tiles' we have a entity of 'Skill', the attributes related to the enity are skills that can be used by the Characters in the game.

<b>Relationship</b>
