<i>The IT Business</i>

JOURNAL #ONE [DES501]

<h2>The IT Business</h2>

The business of IT is an area that I am familiar with, particularly some of the areas discussed in the course topics such as:

- Inventory Management Systems 
- Management Information Systems
- Customer Relationship Systems

All these technology tools are essential for businesses to communicate with customer, partners, suppliers and stockists, and to manage the functions of their internal organisations. I have been fortunate to be able to implement these tools in organisations to improve the speed and effectiveness of departments, which can tangibly improve the offering to customers through automation and the electronic storage of information.

The adoption of technology is not only useful for businesses moving from a manual or paper-based process to a digital way of working but also when developing or replacing older technologies with newer alternatives. The benefits of implementing technology should be communicated to stakeholders to gain their support and lead to the success of the project.

Experience throughout my career has allowed me to witness first-hand the benefits of technological systems. My partner and I established an online clothing store and after investigating several options from a bespoke build developed by a local web developer, to an ‘off the shelf’ content management system, we decided to deploy a Shopify store. From a business user point of view, we couldn’t have asked for a better start for our start-up business.

Shopify allowed us to create an online business quickly, with limited technical expertise and with minimal capital expenditure. The system they offer provided all the features we had hoped for including:

- Web-based Store
- Inventory Management
- Sales Tracking
- Customer Communications
- Integrated payment processing
- Design templates 
- Systems security 

Technology has never made setting up a business so easy. It was invaluable when we went travelling for 3 months, allowing us to continue the business whilst on the road. The flip side of all of this, however, is that it is all too easy to get lost in the crowd. Getting noticed on social media platforms requires a significant amount of work and effort, consistency and quality of both the product and advertising materials were key to maintaining a loyal customer base.

<h2>Important IT Roles</h2>

I am aware of the various roles in IT however, it was good to discuss these in class - it reaffirmed some of the courses choices I had made for my final academic year. It also gave me confidence in my skill set and my career background, I have experience managing teams with a heavy reliance on IT systems, this has involved developing new systems and adapting existing systems to perform different functions in other departments.

The experience gained is from a business user perspective, and it was a desire to understand how systems are developed from a technical IT perspective that led to my pursuing a degree in IT. The intention is to be of greater value to businesses and organisations by being able to speak the language of both business and technical users of systems, operationally and at all stages of the system development lifecycle.
