JOURNAL #SEVEN [RES701]

<h2>Peer Reviewed Journal</h2>

It has not been an easy task... selecting which of my colleagues blogs to review! After careful consideration and much deliberation I have decided to discuss Prapti Mane's blog, specifically blog one. 

What struck me the most is Prapti's ability to reflect in a very personable way, I often find this to be the case when reading the work of others. This is a style of writing that I generally steer away from in favour of a more professional stance mostly in the third person, which isn't away necessary, and I envy the ability of others to produce articles in this more relaxed way. It has certainly made me more self-critical of my own writing style and reflection on research.

The introduction eases the reader into the article in a way that is relatable to a broad demographic. This use of relatable conversation is further deployed in the form of a case study, which is excellent because it lays out the way in which we use research everyday, making it is easy to understand to concepts.

The article continues by providing what could be considered a concise and clear academic definition to explain research, but again brings it back to a personable style that is appropriate the to forum, particularly when stating that the skills are in us, and how they can be beneficial in our work and personal lives. I like this approach. 

The discussion also looks at how research skills can be used and what they are capable of addressing, as well as the various types of research methods. The reader is provided with a well constructed overview and introduction to research.

This approach is continued throughout the blog, Prapti provides a personal viewpoint to each question asked and a reflection of an instance from personal experience that applies to the subject matter. This shows a clear understanding of the material and makes it an interesting read, particularly when it coupled with a referenced definition. 

Conducting this article review was really useful, it reminded me of the different approaches that are taken and how they can influence my own understanding of the subject matter. I will take this experience to continue the development of my own style and analysis of research.
