# Credability


For my credability scale I will be using the same one as discussed in class: Between 1 and 10 (1 is not credible, 10 is totally credible).


## Computational Thinking


### Article One



1. URL: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2696102/]()
2. Search Term: Computational thinking
3. How I found it: Google Scholar
4. Author: Jeannette M. Wing
5. Date: 2008 Jul 31
6. Publication: Scholar Journal
7. Credability: 9


The reason I gave this journal a 9 is that it is a scholarly article, written by someone at a university. Typically, if someone is writing a scholarly journal, they are studying the field. The way that it is written with complexity and jargon used gives me a good indication that they know the field well, therefore are a reliable source of information. There are also references to lots of other professional/academic papers, which boosts the credibility even more. They are also well qualified in a series of fields: Philos, Trans, A Math, Phys, Eng, Sci; this means that they are very qualified and intellectual in general and will have a good grasp on what they are saying/researching. The website is also on a .gov domain, for a government to back/post this sort of thing it must have to be very reliable; they are putting a big reputation on the line and will want to make sure that the source is very credible and valid.



### Article Two



1. URL: [https://www.computationalthinking.org/]()
2. Search Term: Computational thinking
3. How I found it: Duck Duck Go search
4. Author: Computational Thinking Organisation
5. Date: No date
6. Publication: Organisation webpage
7. Credability: 9


The reason I gave this webpage a 9 is that it is straight from the computational thinking webpage, which is literally a domain that is computational thinking. They are backed by Wolfram Research which is a very well respected and reliable research group. They do all sort of research into various subjects including math, coding, data science, and modelling. The man behind Wolfram is pretty much the founder of computer math, in which we use machines for calculations and remove humans from the picture; he is one of the ones to push computational thinking. Because he is one of the most respected founding members of the area, I would say that him/his group has one of the most, if not the most, credible and valid research and information in the area. I could not quite give it a 10 because of there being no references or citations to any other studies.



### Article Three



1. URL: [https://www.academia.edu/39175317/Computational_Thinking_A_Strategy_for_Developing_Problem_Solving_Skills_and_Higher_Order_Thinking_Skills_HOTS]()
2. Search Term: Computational thinking academic paper
3. How I found it: Duck Duck Go search
4. Author: Nur Lisa Zaharin, Sabariah Sharif, Muralindran Mariappan
5. Date: 09 Nov 2018 
6. Publication: Academic paper
7. Credability: 9


The reason I gave this paper an 8 is that, for one, it is published by the International Journal of Academic Research in Business and Social Sciences (IJ-ARBSS); this is a major plus in terms of credibility as it would have to have been looked over very thoroughly before being published. The journal is peer reviewed so they would have had other academics in the area read and grade the paper before release. Another point to say that this source is credible is that then, after being published by the IJ-ARBSS, have been put up on the academia.edu webpage which is a very credible and valid. I was close to giving this one a 10 but I think it would be hard to give any piece of research a 10 if it is done by students at a university, as they are at the start of their learning and are not in their maturity yet. If this were written by a professor or someone in the field it would have scored higher.



## Virtualisation Technology


### Article One



1. URL: [https://globaljournals.org/GJCST_Volume13/1-Virtualization-Technology-Literature-Review.pdf]()
2. Search Term: Virtualisation technology academic paper
3. How I found it: Duck Duck Go search
4. Author: Richard Scroggins
5. Date: 2013 
6. Publication: Academic paper
7. Credability: 9


The reason I gave this paper a 9 is that it is from a rather esteemed research journal, Global Journal of Computer Science and Technology Interdisciplinary; on top of that it is also a Double-Blind Peer Reviewed International Research Journal, which adds to the credibility even more. Another point to bolster the credibility even more is that the actual paper was written in the Capella University. There are plenty of references, which means that the information he has not come up with himself is sourced properly. Overall it is a very professional piece of writing, structured well and laid out very nicely; from a visual standpoint this adds quite a lot to the credibility, even if the information was incorrect, with the layout it has it would just seem credible.



### Article Two



1. URL: [https://www.vmware.com/solutions/virtualization.html]()
2. Search Term: Virtualisation technology
3. How I found it: Duck Duck Go search
4. Author: VMWare
5. Date: No date
6. Publication: Business webpage 
7. Credability: 8


The reason I gave this webpage an 8 is that it is not a scholarly journal or article, it is a company website. They do specialise in VM software, so because this is what their business is, they must have a good credibility, or no one would buy their products. I am sure that the people there are graduates from university or such, so they would have a good idea what they are talking about, it might not be as in-depth or studied as someone writing a research paper/journal. There are not any references on the website, so it is unknown where they have sourced their information from, whether that be from inhouse or externally sourced. It has a very basic layout and structure, so the layman can read it, this means that some of the more in-depth stuff might be glossed over a bit, giving a little less credibility.


### Article Three 


1. URL: [https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/virtualization-a-complete-guide]()
2. Search Term: Virtualisation technology
3. How I found it: Duck Duck Go search
4. Author:  IBM Cloud Education 
5. Date: 19 June 2019
6. Publication: Business webpage
7. Credability: 8


The reason I gave this webpage an 8 is that, similarly to VMWare, it is a corporate website, not an academic journal. There are no references to any of the information; and a lot of the page is just trying to sell you on their product, they could make it seem like something that it is not or exaggerate the potential of the product for the sake of sales or marketing. I think that it might offer a slightly more in-depth look at virtualisation software, but probably not much more than what was on the VMWare website. IBM is a relatively well-respected business who are quite large in the industry, this gives them a big of promise that what they are saying is credible, but there again so is VMWare; the difference here is that VMWare's focus in completely on virtualisation software, whereas IBM has their fingers in more pies, so to say. So, this lack of direct focus probably takes away that extra credibility that IBM had over VMWare.
