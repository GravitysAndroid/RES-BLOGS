# Credability


For my credability scale I will be using the same one as discussed in class: Between 1 and 10 (1 is not credible, 10 is totally credible).


## Computational Thinking


### Article One



1. URL: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2696102/]()
2. Search Term: Computational thinking
3. How I found it: Google Scholar
4. Author: Jeannette M. Wing
5. Date: 2008 Jul 31
6. Publication: Scholar Journal
7. Credability: 9


The reason I gave this journal a 9 is that it is a scholarly article, written by someone at a university. Typically if someone is writing a scholarly journal they are studying the particular field. The way that it is written with complexity and jargon used gives me a good indication that they know the field well, therefore are a realiable source of information. There are also references to lots of other professional/academic papers, which boosts the credability even more. They are also well qualified in a series of fields: Philos Trans A Math Phys Eng Sci; this means that they are very qualified and intellectual in general and will have a good grasp on what they are saying/researching. The website is also on a .gov domain, for a government to back/post this sort of thing it must have to be very reliable; they are putting a big reputation on the line and will want to make sure that the source is very credile and valid.



### Article Two



1. URL: [https://www.computationalthinking.org/]()
2. Search Term: Computational thinking
3. How I found it: Duck Duck Go search
4. Author: Computational Thinking Organisation
5. Date: No date
6. Publication: Organisation webpage
7. Credability: 9


The reason I gave this webpage a 9 is that it is straight from the computational thinking webpage; which is literally a domain that is computational thinking. They are backed by Wolfram Research which is a very well respected and realiable reasearch group. They do all sort of research into various subjects including; math, coding, data science, and modeling. The man behind Wolfram is pretty much the founder of computer math, in which we use machines for calculations and remove humans from the picture; he is one of the ones to push computational thinking. Because he is one of the most respected founding members of the area I would say that him/his gorup has one of the most, if not the most, credible and valid research and information in the area. I couldn't quite give it a 10 because of there being no references or citations to any other studies.



### Article Three



1. URL: [https://www.academia.edu/39175317/Computational_Thinking_A_Strategy_for_Developing_Problem_Solving_Skills_and_Higher_Order_Thinking_Skills_HOTS]()
2. Search Term: Computational thinking academic paper
3. How I found it: Duck Duck Go search
4. Author: Nur Lisa Zaharin, Sabariah Sharif, Muralindran Mariappan
5. Date: 09 Nov 2018 
6. Publication: Academic paper
7. Credability: 9


The reason I gave this paper an 8 is that, for one, it is published by the  International Journal of Academic Research in Business and Social Sciences (IJ-ARBSS); this is a major plus in terms of credibility as it would have to have been looked over very thouroughly before being published. The journal is peer reviewed so they would have had other academics in the area read and grade the paper before release. Another point to say that this source is credable is that then, after being published by the IJ-ARBSS, have been put up on the academia.edu webpage which is a very credible and valid. I was close to giving this one a 10 but I think it would be hard to give any piece of research a 10 if it is done by students at a university, as they are at the start of their learning and aren't in their maturity yet. If this was written by a professor or someone in the field it would have scored higher.



## Virtualisation Technology
