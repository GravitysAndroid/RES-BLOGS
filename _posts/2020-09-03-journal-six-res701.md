<i>Academic Articles</i>

JOURNAL #SIX [RES701]

<h2>Academic Articles</h2>

The purpose of this exercise is to search for two academic articles that relate to IT or computing, and identify the attributes that we believe make them <i>'academic'</i>.

I've being using ProQuest in another class so I wanted to get better acquainted with Google Scholar as an academic journal search engine. I have become more interested in how cloud computing and cloud solutions benefit companies and organisations, so have chosen to base the search around this topic. 

It was a challenge finding articles that were available fee free, however once I discovered the suggested Google search options several articles were listed in the results that gained my interest, I have chosen the two that most stood out to me.

<h3>Article One</h3>

<b>Title and author(s) of the article:</b><br>
Title - The perceived business benefit of cloud computing: An exploratory study.<br>
Authors - T Chen, TT Chuang, K Nakatani. 

<b>APA reference (give it your best shot!) (try using the ‘cite’ option on Google Scholar):</b><br>
Chen, T., Chuang, T. T., & Nakatani, K. (2016). The perceived business benefit of cloud computing: An exploratory study. Journal of International Technology and Information Management, 25(4), 7.

<b>How you found the article and what keywords you used:</b><br>
Google Scholar search - '<i>"exploratory study" cloud computing adoption'</i>.

<b>What kind of article it is, (journal paper, conference paper, masters thesis….):</b><br>
The article is referenced as a Journal Paper.

<b>All the reasons that you think it is an academic article:</b>
1. Found on Google Scholar which attempts to screen out non-academic work
2. A clearly constructed abstract and detailed introduction
3. The authors affiliations are with universities or organisations operating within the industry 
4. A literature review of numerous papers relevant to the topic
5. Research method and hypothesis included in the journal
6. Analysis of the data obtained plus a discussion of the findings
7. A conclusion that lists a clearly defined set of results
8. A large collection of references

<b>How well it fits the ‘structure of an academic article’:</b><br>
The structure of the article fits that expected from this type of academic journal.

<b>Number of references:</b>
The article contains 49 references.

<b>Number of citations:</b>
The article has been cited 22 times.

<b>For articles that you found online, the url of the article:</b><br>
[http://scholarworks.lib.csusb.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1297&context=jitim](http://scholarworks.lib.csusb.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1297&context=jitim)

<b>Are you interested in properly reading the article or not (and give some reasons!):</b>

I am very interested in this article, I have some experience in supporting the process of cloud adoption by organisations, albeit on a very small scale. My interest in cloud technology has only increased since starting this degree. I see many benefits and opportunities from a business perspective in taking advantage of the services offered by the cloud including operational efficiencies, reduced budgetary requirements, scalability and capability advantages. 

Gaining a clearer understanding of the reasons that lead to cloud adoption, and challenging my thinking and assumptions can help to improve my ability to support the decision making process when I re-enter the workplace.

<h3>Article Two</h3>

<b>Title and author(s) of the article:</b><br>
Title - Cloud computing adoption model for governments and large enterprises.<br>
Author - Trivedi, Hrishikesh.

<b>APA reference (give it your best shot!) (try using the ‘cite’ option on Google Scholar):</b><br>
Trivedi, H. (2013). Cloud computing adoption model for governments and large enterprises.

<b>How you found the article and what keywords you used:</b><br>
Google Scholar search - <i>'cloud computing adoption model'</i>.

<b>What kind of article it is, (journal paper, conference paper, masters thesis….):</b><br>
The article is referenced as a Masters Thesis.

<b>All the reasons that you think it is an academic article:</b>
1. Found on Google Scholar which attempts to screen out non-academic work
2. A clearly constructed abstract and detailed introduction
3. The author affiliations are with MIT, and it is a supervised thesis by a Professor of MIT School of Engineering
4. A literature review of several papers relevant to the topic
5. Detailed research methodology and thesis structure
6. Detailed case studies followed by Systems Modelling
7. A conclusion that details the progress made by the organisations studied
8. A large collection of references

<b>How well it fits the ‘structure of an academic article’:</b><br>
The structure of the article fits that expected from this type of academic journal, being a master thesis it contains great detail from the study of the research.

<b>Number of references:</b>

<b>Are you interested in properly reading the article or not (and give some reasons!):</b>

I am very interested in reading this article as it relates to large enterprises. My career experience has limited experience with large organisations so I would be keen to understand how cloud solutions are adopted by governments and large enterprises and what the models to adoption look like. I'm particularly interested in this article as it was produced at MIT which is a highly respected institution.
