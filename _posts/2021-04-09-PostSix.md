# Academic Articles

## Article One
Cureton, K. J., Collins, M. A., Hill, D. W., & McElhannon Jr, F. M. (1988). Muscle hypertrophy in men and women. Medicine and science in sports and exercise, 20(4), 338-344.

- Title and author(s) of the article
- APA reference (give it your best shot!) (try using the ‘cite’ option on Google Scholar)
- how you found the article and what keywords you used
- what kind of article it is, ( journal paper, conference paper, masters thesis…..)
- all the reasons that you think it is an academic article
- how well it fits the ‘structure of an academic article’ that I described in my previous post
- how many references it has
- how many citations it has (if you can find out)
- for articles that you found online, the url of the article
- say whether you are interested in properly reading the article or not (and give some reasons!)


## Article Two
S Aggarwal, J Verma - International Journal of Recent Research Aspects, 2018 - ijrra.net

- APA reference (give it your best shot!) (try using the ‘cite’ option on Google Scholar)
- how you found the article and what keywords you used
- what kind of article it is, ( journal paper, conference paper, masters thesis…..)
- all the reasons that you think it is an academic article

Note I am not asking you to read the articles you find (although of course you can if you want to!) - we will be working on strategies for reading academic articles later - but to look at the structure and characteristics of the things you find. This eventually becomes second nature and you can tell from a quick scan of an article how ‘academic’ or ‘credible’ it is likely to be. Initially though it is about assessing it for the things I have mentioned above and making your decision!
