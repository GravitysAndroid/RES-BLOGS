## Article One

https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Fulltext/2010/10000/The_Mechanisms_of_Muscle_Hypertrophy_and_Their.40.aspxLike

  The Mechanisms of Muscle Hypertrophy and Their Application to Resistance Training; Schoenfeld, Brad

- APA reference
  Schoenfeld, Brad J The Mechanisms of Muscle Hypertrophy and Their Application to Resistance Training, Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research: October 2010 - Volume 24 - Issue 10 - p 2857-2872
  doi: 10.1519/JSC.0b013e3181e840f3

- how you found the article and what keywords you used
  Searched for, "Muscle hypertrophy" in Google Scholar, recognised the author and clicked on the link, this then lead to the webpage/article

- what kind of article it is, ( journal paper, conference paper, masters thesis…..)

- all the reasons that you think it is an academic article
- how well it fits the ‘structure of an academic article’ that I described in my previous post
- how many references it has
- how many citations it has (if you can find out)
- for articles that you found online, the url of the article
- say whether you are interested in properly reading the article or not (and give some reasons!)

## Article Two

www.ijrra.net/Vol5issue1/IJRRA-05-01-26.pdf

- Title and author(s) of the article
- APA reference (give it your best shot!) (try using the ‘cite’ option on Google Scholar)
- how you found the article and what keywords you used
- what kind of article it is, ( journal paper, conference paper, masters thesis…..)
- all the reasons that you think it is an academic article
- how well it fits the ‘structure of an academic article’ that I described in my previous post
- how many references it has
- how many citations it has (if you can find out)
- for articles that you found online, the url of the article
- say whether you are interested in properly reading the article or not (and give some reasons!)

Note I am not asking you to read the articles you find (although of course you can if you want to!) - we will be working on strategies for reading academic articles later - but to look at the structure and characteristics of the things you find. This eventually becomes second nature and you can tell from a quick scan of an article how ‘academic’ or ‘credible’ it is likely to be. Initially though it is about assessing it for the things I have mentioned above and making your decision!
