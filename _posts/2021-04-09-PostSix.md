# Academic Articles

## Article One

### Title and author(s) of the article

The Mechanisms of Muscle Hypertrophy and Their Application to Resistance Training; Schoenfeld, Brad.

### APA reference

Schoenfeld, Brad J The Mechanisms of Muscle Hypertrophy and Their Application to Resistance Training, Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research: October 2010 - Volume 24 - Issue 10 - p 2857-2872
doi: 10.1519/JSC.0b013e3181e840f3

### How you found the article and what keywords you used

Searched for, "Muscle hypertrophy" in Google Scholar, recognised the author and clicked on the link, this then lead to the webpage/article.

### What kind of article it is, ( journal paper, conference paper, masters thesis…..)

This article is an academic journal paper.

### All the reasons that you think it is an academic article

The reason that this article is an academic one is because it is published by: "The Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research, which is an offical research journal of the National Strength and Conditioning Association. So it is an article published by an actual academic journal. I can tell by the writing in the journal that there is a lot of jargon that definetly makes the author of the article seem very well versed in this field. There are also a lot of references to other works at the bottom, which also suggests that it is a well researched and looked into article; because they take thier referencing seriously it is most definetly an academic article. I also found the article on Google Scholar which only displays academic articles.

### How well it fits the ‘structure of an academic article’ that I described in my previous post

The structure of the article fits the academic article type that was previously disclosed.

### How many references it has

205 references.

### How many citations it has (if you can find out)

This article has 1146 citations.

### For articles that you found online, the url of the article

https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Fulltext/2010/10000/The_Mechanisms_of_Muscle_Hypertrophy_and_Their.40.aspxLike#O4-40-5

### Say whether you are interested in properly reading the article or not (and give some reasons!)

I would definetly read the article as it is about something that I'm very fond of, weight lifting/muscle growth. I have already watched a lot of videos on YouTube that have referenced this particular article because of its particularly robust and interesting scientific findings. The author of the article is rather well known in the fitness industry for high quality and unbiased research. Even though I have already watched lots of videos on it, it would be interesting to actually fully read the source material that they have been referencing.

## Article Two

### Title and author(s) of the article

Comparative analysis of MEAN stack and MERN stack; Sanchit Aggarwal & Jyoti Verma.

### APA reference (give it your best shot!) (try using the ‘cite’ option on Google Scholar)

Aggarwal, S., & Verma, J. (2018). Comparative analysis of MEAN stack and MERN stack. International Journal of Recent Research Aspects, 5(1), 127-32.

### How you found the article and what keywords you used

I used Google Scholar to find the article; with the keywords, "MEAN stack".

### What kind of article it is, ( journal paper, conference paper, masters thesis…..)

It seems to be an academic journal.

### All the reasons that you think it is an academic article

It is published in a research journal at an engineering college, assumably by computer engineer students. The structure of the article is in the same academic article format, with an abstract, introduction, content and references. There is a lot of jargon in the article, giving me the impression that this is a credible journal and the authors know what they are writing about. The total number of references at the bottom is quite a few, meaning that they have done their research and are referencing it in an academic way. I also found the article on Google Scholar, which publishes academic articles.

### How well it fits the ‘structure of an academic article’ that I described in my previous post

It matches the academic journal format well.

### How many references it has

There is a total of 30 references.

### How many citations it has (if you can find out)

It has 4 citations.

### For articles that you found online, the url of the article

### Say whether you are interested in properly reading the article or not (and give some reasons!)

I probably would read this article in full, mainly because of its relatively short length; If it was much longer than the 5 pages that it is, I probably wouldn't read it. I am interested in web development but it seems really dry to read about the different frameworks in an academic sense. I would rather have practical experience with them, rather than reading a comparative analysis. If it aimed to achieve something rahter than being an analysis it would have been far more engaging.
