<i>Conceptual ERD development process - created by Team Excellence</i>

JOURNAL #TWO [DAT601]

Learning Summary<br>

Much of the group effort this week has revolved around furthering our understanding of the symbols avaliable to 

Chens Rule for the ERD: attributes cannot participate in another relationship, if an attribute needs to participate in relationships with other entites then we must consider that the attribute is in fact its own entity.  

<b><u>WHAT</u></b>




<b>Weak (Child) Entity & Strong (Parent) Entity:</b>




<b>Weak Relationship:</b>




<b>Mandatory (Total) & Optional (Partial) Participation:</b>




<b>Mandatory (Total) & Optional (Partial) Participation:</b>

<b><u>WHY</u></b>

Creating ERDs is extremely useful when trying to understand how a business system or organisation functions. 

ERDs allow all users or potential users of the system to visualize who the entities are that interact with the data system, what the relationships are between the entities and what attributes are associated with the entities. The development team can use the diagram to determine what the technical requirements are of the software system, and what data is required.

Fundamentally ERDs help stakeholders of the system, in conjunctions with other diagramming techniques, to create a visual image of how the data in the system is connected in a very general way. This is so beneficial because multiple user groups are able to review and provide input based on their perspective.

Having come from a business development background, and been through critical change processes in local government, I have participated in the support process of large technical change. This experience has allowed me to see how the data from multiple systems would need to be integrated into a single system to be used across multiple government departments. 

The more complex a system, which often comes with the age of the system and data stored, and historically poor planning and implementation means these higher level diagrams are even more useful in attempting to gain an understanding of the multiple elements involved in the development.

<b><u>HOW</u></b>

Developing my understanding of the ERD at conceptual level has been helped by prior learning from last semester in DAT502. 

I find class work provides a solid base in which to carry out personal research. It was doing this that I discovered that there variations to what is included at the conceptual level and what then is added at the logical level. I also found this in DAT502. 

I can see in a practical way how leaving attributes out at the conceptual level may be of benefit when dealing with people who are not technically minded, but nevertheless need to understand and provide input to a system. 

Once everyone is working on the same page, attributes can then be added at the logical level in an incremental way. 

The caveat to this is that a technical team might prefer attributes to be listed at the conceptual level, as they are more familiar with the technique and could speed up their understanding.

As a result of having a working background in business I generally try to apply my learning to business environments, which is useful when trying to retain the information and specific details. 

Saying that, this course relates to systems development with regards to gaming, of which I know next to nothing. However the challenge will be fun, and a game is still a business entity, especially if there are options to introduce paid add-ons within the game play, which is the case with applications from the Apple App store for instance. 

I have been fortunate in joining a team where the other contributors are gamers and they have proven extremely useful in plugging the gaps in my knowledge, specifically surrounding how a game such as this might work and operate. There is also some crossover with other systems, such as player login which functions in the same way as an email login for example. 

Below is the documentation produced to accompany the ERD displayed in the image of this Journal.
