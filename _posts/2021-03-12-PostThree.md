# Research Paradigms
There are many different types of paradigm; classic scientific, which contains: realism and positivism, social science, which contains: constuctivism and Interpretivism, and post modernism, which contains: nominalism and anti-positivism/relativism.

Research paradigms are usually implimented after the researcher finalises the topic they are researching; they then think about the approach or methodology to the actual research. There are three questions that the researcher can ask themselves before they actually begin the research:


1. The ontological inquiry: What is the reality that the researcher wants to explore and know? 

2. The epistemological inquiry: What is it (the ontology) that is available to explore and how to reach it? 

3. The methodological inquiry: What are the methods and procedures that will make this inquiry possible?


("What are Research Paradigms? - Helping Research writing for student & professional researchers", 2021)


The above questions are part of the research paradigms; a paradigm is a way of viewing things about how to go about researching. Paradigms include the methodology, approach, ontology, and epistemology surrounding research. A paradigm isn't limited to one specific methodology; there can be multiple methodologies per paradigm. The methodologies are ways that the researcher can approach the research in a systematic way.

The main paradigms I will be taking a look at are:

- Classic Scientific Paradigm

- Social Science Paradigm

- Post-Modernist Approach


## Classic Scientific Paradigm


The classic scientific paradigm is heavily focused on:


- What can be observed and scrutinised

- What questions are supposed to be asked and what answers are to be probed for

- How the questions are structured

- What predictions are made by the primary theory in the discipline

- How the scientific investigation should be interpreted

- How an experiment is to be conducted, and what equipment is avaliable to be used for that experiment


The main concept of the scientific paradigm is that the scientific process is not linear but cyclical. In the cycles a scientific paradigm is a set of assumptions that are made to build on top of, there is a foundation already in place for future research to build on. There are assumptions made that the researcher already knows the existing research.


In postivism there is a heavy focus on objectivity, knowability, and decutive logic. Taking a positivist look at things means that you would interpret society emperically and scientifically. Positivism also wants a value-free sociology, where the researches abandon their bias and values to seek out objective, emperical, and knowable truth. It really takes a step back and looks at things from a purely objective stance, that is highly scientific.

## Social Science Paradigm


Tied in with social paradigms is the view point that all truth is varying, socially constructed, and ever-changing; this is vastly different from the previously mentioned positivism. This view point is taken from a social constructionism view. Along side this is that reality is created collectivly by society; and that social context and interaction from our realities. this way of thinking is useful and makes sense to some extent, but I find it hard to believe that there are not any objective truths at all. Things such as gravity, to me, are objective fact that persist even if everyone in society disagres, it doesn't mean that it is not an absolute truth.


There are three main key factors in social constructivism:


- The theory of social constructionism states that meaning and knowledge are socially created.

- Social constructionists believe that things that are generally viewed as natural or normal in society, such as understandings of gender, race, class, and disability, are socially constructed, and consequently aren’t an accurate reflection of reality.

- Social constructs are often created within specific institutions and cultures and come to prominence in certain historical periods. Social constructs’ dependence of historical, political, and economic conditions can lead them to evolve and change.

## Post-Modernist Approach


"Postmodernism, also spelled post-modernism, in Western philosophy, a late 20th-century movement characterized by broad skepticism, subjectivism, or relativism; a general suspicion of reason; and an acute sensitivity to the role of ideology in asserting and maintaining political and economic power." 


("postmodernism | Definition, Doctrines, & Facts", 2021)


In post modernism there are eight main characteristics:


- That there is an objective natural reality, that exists independently of human beings


- That descriptive and explanatory statementes made by humans can be objectivly true or false.


- Through logic and reason humans will change themselves and society for the better.


- Reason and logic are universally valid


- Human nature exists and it is made of faculties, aptitudes, or dispositions that are in humans at birth rather than learned


- Language refers to a reality outside of itself, it is not a mirror of nature
 

- Humans can acquire knowledge about natural reality, This knowledge can be justified on the basis of evidence or principles that are intuitive and certain.


- That it is possible to construct general theories that explain nature and society, within the current human knowledge

Post modernism can be described as a set of critical, strategic, and rhetorical practices that employ difference, repitition, the trace, the simulacrum, and hyperreality; it then uses these concepts to destabilise other concepts like presense, identity, historical progress, epistemic certainty, and the univocity of meaning.
