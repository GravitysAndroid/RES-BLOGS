JOURNAL #ONE [RES701]

<h2>Researching Research</h2>

<h3>What do I think research is?</h3> 

If I were to take a simple approach I would describe research as a method to learn or discovering something you didn't previously know, or confirm or test earlier findings through the process of gathering and analysing data and information. Research is a widely used and important practice in everyday scenarios but particularly in academic, commercial and scientific endeavors.  

However, in order to provide a complete and academic response I will research, research...

<b>My findings:</b>

Research is a process whereby consideration is made to a given field of study. It includes inquiry into collections of data and information gathered. A critical analysis and thoughtful interpretation of information is then documented in accordance with suitable methodologies as required by academic disciplines or professional standards. This inquiry facilitates the explaining and defining of the outcomes of the information gathered, as a result of the carrying out the research as observed. 

<i>Reference:</i> What is research?, [https://www.hampshire.edu/dof/what-is-research](https://www.hampshire.edu/dof/what-is-research)

Research can be both inductive, which is used to analyse an observed event, or deductive, which verifies an observed event. 

There are many reasons why research is carried out, but its purpose if ultimately to allow for understanding of a given subject matter. It is useful to start by understanding what it is a researcher needs to find out, what processes need to be followed, what the arguments are and what evidence will be needed that support those arguments. 

<b>Research can be characterised as follows:</b>

1. Follow a systematic approach which includes rules and procedures to ensure the accuracy of the data being interpreted. Applying a code of conduct which is based in ethical considerations is good practice, particularly when drawing conclusions to the observations.
2. Conduct research using logical reasoning and include inductive methods and deductive methods.
3. Ensure that information gathered is obtained in real time, in a natural setting and is derived from an actual observation of the subject matter.
4. Carry out an in depth analysis of all the data and information collected to ensure that any problems or anomalies are identified and documented.
5. Use the data gathered to further understanding, and to seek opportunities to ask questions not previously considered.
6. Due to the analytical nature of research, it is important that all the data gathered is documented to reduce the potential for ambiguity. 
7. Ensure that the research documented is accurate, measured and true to its nature.

<b>There are five defined types of research methods as described below:</b>

<b>1 - Basic research</b>

Basic research takes a collection of documented data to enhance the knowledge of the researcher or reader. It is not used in a commercial capacity to create or invent something.

<b>2 - Applied research</b>

Applied research is used to for the purpose of solving a real life practical problem through the analyses of the gathered information.

<b>3 - Problem oriented research</b>

Problem oriented research is carried out to find solutions to a problem or multiple problems through an increased understanding of the exact nature of the problem or problems.

<b>4 - Problem solving research</b>

Problem solving research is conducted in order to gain an understanding of an organisations or companies problem in order to discover a suitable resolution.

<b>5 - Qualitative research</b>

Qualitative research is conducted to understand issues that exist in their natural settings, this type of research is a process of inquiry and is dependant on the experience of the researchers involved and questions used. Methods used in qualitative research are:

1. One on one interviews
2. Focus groups
3. Ethnographic research
4. Analysis of content 
5. Case studies 

<b>Research is conducted for a number of reasons:</b>

1. Exploratory purpose - To explore a question or questions. Analyses of the results will not always produce a final conclusion but can be used to explore areas that had not previously been considered.

2. Descriptive purpose - To expand the knowledge of current problems of issues through the collection of further information or data. This can then be used to describe, explain and validate findings. 

3. Explanatory purpose - To understand the impact or any changes in existing procedures or processes. Understanding the effect of any changes can aid decision making processes.

In conclusion, research is a collection of tools or instruments that can be used to support the goals of a study and through observation and accurate documentation can allow for the drawing of appropriate conclusions.

<h3>Do I think I will ever need research skills?</h3>

This is almost a moot question, it is not a case of “thinking” whether I will need research skills in the future, it is a certainty. I have relied heavily on research skills in multiple positions in my career and currently employ these skills throughout the degree process. 

Experience has taught me that research methods inform so much of our lives, from applications in professional sectors such as business, science, and the law, to personal pursuits such as travelling to property renovation. Research is used in a range of principles from creating solutions to large complex projects to applying for finance for clients looking to expand their business, even deciding which restaurants to eat at in new places yet to visit. 

Research conducted with a methodical approach allows us to consider options, or arrive at conclusion we might have otherwise missed, and as such is an invaluable tool. Research is a tool I am using throughout each course of this degree, and which I will continue to employ and improve upon in my career after my degree has ended

<h3>What do I think a research journal is and who do you think they are written for?</h3>

A research journal is an article that is published to provide current information and data on an intellectually relevant subject or topic. A research journal is often reviewed and checked in a peer review process before the journal is formally published.

Research journals are incredible useful in that they allow for communication amongst researchers across the world, all of whom are working on solutions to the same or very similar problems. For instance a researcher in England can publish research on a particular subject that is read in New Zealand, and can be used to enhance the work being conducted there.  

Additionally these types of journals can be used to maintain the academic integrity of a given research field and can, through their publication, prevent research from being repeated which can lead to swifter progress within an area of expertise. 

The production of research journals is to allow other academic professionals in the field to study the information that they contain in order to stay informed. This is equally important for both graduate and undergraduate students who can use the journals to further their learning.

<h3>What is plagiarism?</h3>

Practically speaking plagiarism can be viewed as the copying of somebody else's work for personal use and gain, to define it in this way however does not provide a complete picture of what is occurring if such an act is undertaken.

In order to gain a complete picture of plagiarism we must understand what is means to plagiarise another work:

- it is theft to take work that is not ours for the purposes of passing it of as your own
- if you choose to use another's work it must be credited to avoid accusations of plagiarism 
- it is a form of literary theft 
- it is the passing of an idea or product as new for original, when it was in fact derived from another

The act being performed is that of stealing the work and then being deliberately deceitful about its origins. It is important to understand that in a lot of jurisdictions around the world this acts is covered by copyright laws.

<b>Plagiarism includes the following:</b>

- submitting work carried out by someone else as your own
- not crediting sources when using their words or ideas
- removing quotation marks in direct quotes
- falsifying the source of a quotation
- following the sentence structure of a source but not giving credit to that source
- using a significant portion of words or concepts from a single source, credit given or not 
- using images or other media from other sources
- using videos or music for use in making a video 
- performing another persons copyrighted music 
- composing music that borrowed from anothers creation

We all rely on others to inform our thinking and our work. However, when it comes to plagiarism it is best to avoid situations where this can occur, or always properly cite the source and seek relevant permissions where possible.

<h3>Why should I avoid plagiarism?</h3>

There are many reasonable considerations that can help us avoid plagiarism over and above the legal ramifications resulting from copyright laws, these considerations include:

- producing individual work can support and ability in creative thinking 
- create a deeper understating of the subject matter and allow for the drawing of individual conclusions
- writing skills are improved over time
- leads to academic integrity and increased retention of information
- avoid the negative consequences associated with the discovery of plagiarised work
- perform better in scenarios where plagiarism cannot be relied upon, such as exam situations
- the satisfaction of producing your own work

It is important to understand that plagiarism is serious, there are numerous examples of instances where individuals have been caught out for plagiarising others work and have suffered the consequences, ranging from being discredited all the way to being subject to legal proceedings. In cases where there is a reliance on the work of others a writer should research the rules, laws and guidelines to ensure they reasonably apply those principles to avoid allegations of plagiarism.
